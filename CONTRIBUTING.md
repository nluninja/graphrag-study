## Contribution Guidelines

### General Rules

- **One resource per pull request** - This makes it easier to review and discuss each addition
- **Search before adding** - Make sure your resource isn't already listed
- **Check your spelling and grammar** - Ensure descriptions are clear and professional
- **Verify links** - All URLs must be working and point to the correct resource
- **Follow the format** - Match the existing structure and style
- **Keep descriptions concise** - Aim for 1-2 sentences that clearly explain the resource's value

### What to Include

We welcome contributions in the following categories:

- **Papers** - Academic research, preprints, surveys (must include link to paper)
- **Frameworks and Tools** - Open source projects, libraries, platforms
- **Tutorials and Courses** - Educational content, guides, notebooks
- **Videos and Talks** - Conference presentations, tutorial videos, webinars
- **Blog Posts** - Technical articles, deep dives, case studies
- **Datasets** - Knowledge graphs, benchmarks, evaluation datasets
- **Use Cases** - Real-world applications and implementations

### Quality Standards

Resources should:
- Be directly related to GraphRAG or closely related technologies (knowledge graphs + RAG)
- Provide significant value to the community
- Be accessible (public links, not behind paywalls when possible)
- Be actively maintained (for tools and frameworks)
- Have clear documentation (for code/tools)

### Format Guidelines

#### Papers
```markdown
- **Paper Title** (Authors/Organization, Year)
  - [Paper](URL) | Brief description of contribution
  - Key findings or methodology
```

#### Tools/Frameworks
```markdown
- **[Tool Name](URL)** - Brief description
  - Key feature 1
  - Key feature 2
  - Key feature 3
```

#### Tutorials/Videos
```markdown
- **Title** (Platform, Date if relevant)
  - Brief description of content
  - Target audience or prerequisites if relevant
```

### Alphabetical Order

Within each section, resources should be listed alphabetically. For papers, organize by subsection first, then alphabetically within each subsection.

### Link Format

- Use HTTPS links whenever possible
- For papers, prefer:
  1. Official publication page
  2. arXiv or other preprint server
  3. Author's website
- For code, link to the main repository (preferably GitHub)
- For articles, link to the original publication source

### Section Placement

If you're unsure which section your resource belongs in:
- **Papers** - Peer-reviewed research, arXiv preprints, technical reports
- **Frameworks and Tools** - Code you can use to build GraphRAG systems
- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides and educational content
- **Videos** - Visual/audio content
- **Blog Posts** - Written articles and explainers (non-academic)

### What NOT to Include

Please avoid:
- Promotional or marketing content without technical value
- Broken links or resources that are no longer available
- Duplicate content (check existing entries first)
- Resources behind strict paywalls (academic papers on publisher sites are OK)
- Personal projects without documentation or clear value
- Off-topic resources (pure LLM or pure graph content without RAG relevance)

## Suggesting New Sections

If you believe a new section would benefit the list:
1. Open an issue describing the proposed section
2. Provide at least 3-5 resources that would fit in this section
3. Explain why this deserves its own section

## Reporting Issues

If you find:
- Broken links
- Incorrect information
- Misplaced resources
- Formatting issues

Please open an issue or submit a PR with the fix.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and professional
- Focus on the technical merit of resources
- Assume good faith in discussions
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please:
1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Review this guide thoroughly
3. Open an issue with your question if still unclear

## Recognition

All contributors will be recognized in the project. Significant contributions may be highlighted in release notes.

Thank you for helping make this resource valuable for the GraphRAG community!
